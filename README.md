# Introduction:

The Restaurant Revenue project focuses on exploring and predicting the revenue of restaurants based on various factors and features. A key aspect of this project is understanding the importance of variables and implementing effective feature engineering methods. By analyzing non-anonymized data and applying intuition, we can extract predictive features that contribute to a restaurant's revenue.

The dataset includes several columns, with anonymized features represented as P1-P37. These features consist of demographic, real estate, and commercial data obtained from third-party providers with GIS systems. They encompass information such as population, age and gender distribution, development scales, location size, car park availability, and the presence of points of interest like schools, banks, and other Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) operators.

The primary target variable of interest is the transformed revenue column, which indicates the revenue of the restaurant in a given year. Although the values have been transformed and do not represent real dollar values, they serve as the target for predictive analysis.

In this project, we have undertaken the following key tasks:

Importance of Variables and Feature Engineering Methods:
We have discussed the significance of variables and implemented feature engineering techniques to enhance the predictive power of our models. Through leveraging our intuition and domain knowledge, we have derived meaningful predictors of revenue from the non-anonymized data.

Comparison of Five Different Models:
We have conducted a comparative analysis of five different models to identify the best performing one. By evaluating their performance, we gained insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model, aiding us in selecting the most suitable approach for revenue prediction.

Overview of the Best Performing Model and RMSE Analysis:
We have provided an overview of the best performing model, considering its accuracy and robustness in predicting restaurant revenue. Additionally, we have explained how we achieved the evaluation metric of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's predictive performance.

Through these steps, our project has yielded a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing restaurant revenue and has developed a predictive model that can support informed decision-making for restaurant owners and stakeholders. By applying state-of-the-art data analysis techniques and leveraging machine learning methods, we have unlocked valuable insights to drive actionable recommendations in the restaurant industry.
